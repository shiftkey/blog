## Why Support Remote Workers?

It's very easy for remote working to fail if the company doesn't invest in it.
It requires buy-in from the entire company, but the benefits are significant:

## Topics

 - consider what tools you currently need:
    - are you able to use them outside the office?
    - are there risks when doing this? (security/access/data)
    - are there processes in place to mitigate this? (VPN/remote wipe/etc)

 - have a good chat system in place
    - e.g. [Slack](https://slack.com/)
    - a place for the conversations you'd normally have in the office
    - empower your employees to tailor rooms so them get the most out of it
    - integrate your other systems into chat -> ["chat ops"](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/what-is-chatops/)

 - use video as an alternative, for when synchronous stuff is helpful
    - e.g. [BlueJeans](https://bluejeans.com)
    - let people do things face-to-face
    - it should be easy to setup and use
    - record events and make them available for those who couldn't attend
    - invest in decent recording equipment for large events

 - collaboration
    - e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - define teams within your organization around responsibilities
    - make it easy for people to add themselves to teams
    - try and mention teams instead of people -> information sharing
    - provide context about what you need from the team

### Remote Working Tips

 - treat it like you were working in an office
   - have a routine
   - put on pants
   - remember to take lunch
   - do get out of the house and interact with people
   - try and focus on work so your day doesn't drag out - e.g. [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

 - watch for the [creeping workday](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WorkingRemotelyConsideredDystopian.aspx) routine
   - set boundaries on when you are available for colleagues
   - avoid notifications that can drag you back to work
     - do you really need email on your phone?
     - set Slack's DND so you don't get notifications

 - have a decent workspace at home
   - good chair
   - external monitors
   - as few distractions as possible
   - if others are at home, indicate when you should not be disturbed
      - e.g. ["on air" light](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/recording-studio-light)

### Distributed Teams Tips

 - be aware of the timezones of your colleagues
    - they too will probably be away or trying to avoid notifications
    - treat communications as asynchronous by default
    - fight the urge to be in chat all day and night
    - schedule things long enough in advance that others may make themselves available
       - do not mandate this

 - capture important things for posterity
    - link back to relevant chat discussions in issues or PRs
    - summarize where decisions have been made so others not present are in the loop
    - recording video conferences

 - plan to have some of your day overlap with colleagues
    - this helps address blockers and raise suggestions or issues
    - for things that can be resolved quickly, do it
    - socializing is also pretty important, even if it's only chat

 - co-ordinate work so that everyone is on the same page
    - have plans for the immediate term (e.g. the current sprint's release)
    - know roughly what everyone else is up to - "is everything covered?"
    - have multiple tasks on the go; switch when you become blocked
    - show initiative - are there places you can help out when you find yourself with some spare time?

 - create an environment where you can trust your colleagues
    - there will be hard times as well as good times
    - knowing you can raise problems or issues within your team is important
    - remote people can often feel isolated - being able to be candid and honest helps avoid this

 - be mindful of your written words
    - text lacks much of the nuance and context that we take for granted with speech
    - emotive or rushed replies can inflame an already tense situation
    - cultural differences between colleagues can confuse things
    - don't consider everyone as a strong English speaker
    - as much writing can be done asynchronously, take your time with it
     - try and be succinct - you want people to read the whole thing, not stop midway through due to exhaustion
     - if a long reply is unavoidable, have a [TL;DR:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) at the start to summarize it

 - as a team, catch up in meatspace from time to time
    - when you know the person on the other end of the keyboard, the remote stuff is much easier
    - use this time to do non-work things - strategy, team building, etc
    - the sooner new team members can meet with everyone, the more likely they'll feel like they fit in
