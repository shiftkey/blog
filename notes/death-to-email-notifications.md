title: Death to Email Notifications (and why push notifications are a better option)

I've had this issue rattling around in my head for a while now, and I can't quite explain it well (but here goes anyway).

 - I'm sick of getting emails which are to the effect of "Hey, XYZ happened. Go to this URL for more information"
 - I already filter a lot of these emails away from my inbox, but I'm still left to trawl through them daily/weekly/whatever-ly - which sucks
 - email filters are a rubblish way to handle this
 - doing things like sorting, search, grouping etc from your email client is so 80s

Basically the whole process requires a human to act first, which is not great because humans suck at webscale.
