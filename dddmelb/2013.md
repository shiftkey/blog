title: Think Like a Git @ ddd Melbourne 2013
---

Are you coming along? You will need these things to fully enjoy the workshop:

 - a laptop
 - git installed (I recommend [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) for the easiest way to get started).

Open a terminal (`Git Shell` is a shortcut for Windows) and then do:

 - `git clone https://github.com/shiftkey/dddmelb-git.git`
 - `cd dddmelb-git`
 - `.\setup.bat` (if Windows)
 - `sh .\setup.sh` (if OS X)

If all of these instructions are making you uncomfortable, feel free to just sit back and watch the chaos unfold.
