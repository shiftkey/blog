If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again, I'll update this.

## Where?

All over the place. Read on for details.

## Upcoming Conference Talks

 - **.NET Fringe** - Portland, USA - June 6-10
 - **NDC Sydney** - Sydney, Australia - August 1-5

## Side Projects

Here's what I'm working on at the moment:

 - [Octokit.net](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net) - .NET bindings for the GitHub API
    - reviews

 - [up-for-grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net) - a place to connect project maintainers with people who are interested in getting started with open source
    - rewrite the vision and provide supporting documentation

 - [Rx.NET](https://github.com/reactive-extensions/rx.net/)
    - administrivia

## What about XYZ?

I'm trying to narrow the amount of things I have going on at once to get a
better work-life balance. I don't mind making myself available to bounce ideas
around if time permits, but I'd have to take things off my plate before
considering new work.

## I want to get in touch!

My contact details are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shiftkey/). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), if that's your sort of thing.
