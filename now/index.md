title: What I'm Doing Now
---

## Where?

After a long road trip, I'm back in Australia for the summer (and the silly season)
recharging and just hopefully enjoying the warm weather.

## Side Projects

Here's what I'm working on at the moment:

 - [Octokit.net](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net) - .NET bindings for the GitHub API
    - making build scripts more automated
    - targeting .NET Core

 - [up-for-grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net) - a place to connect project maintainers with people who are interested in getting started with open source
    - rewrite the vision and provide supporting documentation
    - general site design

 - [ReactiveGit](https://github.com/shiftkey/ReactiveGit) - proof-of-concept for combining Reactive Extensions with [libgit2sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp)
    - basically needs a rewrite after getting some good feedback about the Rx

 - lackey - a proof-of-concept for supporting project maintainers
    - Coming Soonâ„¢

There's also some async stuff working with the [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2) and [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows) teams, but that's work-related.

When I have time I've been looking at:

 - **golang** - for some simple web services
 - **Elm** - a promising way to build webapps
 - **Rust** - as an alternative way to do systems programming

## The Future

No speaking plans for the foreseeable future - I need to sit down and build some stuff now I've got my burnout under control again. Oh, and write more.

Stay tuned.

## What about XYZ?

I'm trying to narrow the amount of things I have going on at once to get a better work-life balance. I don't mind making myself available to bounce ideas around if time permits, but I'd have to take things off my plate before considering new work.

## I want to get in touch!

My contact details are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shiftkey/). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), if that's your sort of thing.
