If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again I'll update this.

## Where?

Australia, mostly.

## Upcoming Conferences

 - **GitHub Satellite** - London, Belgium - May 22-23
 - **Techorama** - Antwerp, Belgium - May 23-24
 - **NDC Oslo** - Sydney, Australia - August 12-16 June

## Side Projects

I'm going to be busy shipping stuff over the next couple of months, so I'm not
really going to be focused on anything existing beyond the normal triage of
projects.

## What about XYZ?

I'm trying to narrow the amount of things I have going on at once to get a
better work-life balance. I don't mind making myself available to bounce ideas
around if time permits, but I'd have to take things off my plate before
considering new work.

## I want to get in touch!

My contact details are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shiftkey/). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), if that's your sort of thing.
