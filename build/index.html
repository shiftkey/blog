	<h2>documenting the chaos</h2>
</header>

<section>
	I'll be heading across the pond for the BUILD conference. As I expect, nay, demand connectivity from my conference organisers, I'm planning to capture as much as I can here during sessions.
</section>

<section>
	I'll also try to blog some more details about what I've discovered - but this may not occur until after the conference.
</section>

<h3>the twitter challenge</h3>

<section>
	I put the word out to my followers to set some challenges for me to acheive during the conference.
</section>
	
{% blockquote  @shiftkey http://twitter.com/#!/shiftkey/status/112100572265578496 %}
followers: is there someone at #bldwin who you have a question for? tell me & i'll endeavour to chase them down and get your answer 
{% endblockquote %}
	
<section>
	Challenges I've received so far:
	<ul>
		<li>Find Anders Hejlsberg and get him to confirm AOP is on the roadmap for C# (paraphrasing @philiplaureano)
		<li>Find Anders Hejlsberg and get him to confirm AOP is not on the roadmap for C# (from @JackUkleja) -- <strong>ed: </strong> two questions on one topic which are polar opposites - I think I have to find this out...
		<li>Investigate if the VS team are planning a lightweight version of VS (from @pawelpabich)
		<li>Investigate if the next version of VS will be improving the install experience (from @calebvear)
	</ul>

<section>
Just had a look around the conference before lunch - pretty quiet aside from the green banners everywhere.
</section>

<section>
Will post more once the place is opened up on Monday - that's for registration, not the start of the conference officially...
