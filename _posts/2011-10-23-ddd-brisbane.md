The [dddBrisbane][1] organisers sent out a call over the weekend to finalise the schedule - some very cool talks that I'm looking forward to seeing (look for the schedule to appear early this week). 

I'm especially honoured to see my session was picked - especially after seeing the depth of Windows 8 talks submitted.

So what am I talking about?

## Windows 8 - Who Moved My Cheese?

I'll link back to my abstract once I remember what I submitted, but keep in mind there is another Windows 8 session in the mix - so I'll probably tweak the script to prevent overlap.

What shall we discuss?

   - what is this Windows Runtime thing? 
   - when should I go full metro? and what's classic mode?
   - how do I do X with Windows Runtime?
   - what new feature does Windows Runtime bring?
   - how do I wrap my head around doing client apps in HTML/JS?
   - tips and tricks for maintainable code
   - ...

I'll add links to the content after the talk, so check back for more details.

[Registration][2] is only $25, and the DDD events are always a fun day (especially the after-party, if you can hang around for that).
