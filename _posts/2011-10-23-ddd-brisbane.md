The [dddBrisbane][1] organisers sent out a call over the weekend to finalise the schedule - some very cool talks that I'm looking forward to seeing (look for the schedule to appear early this week).

I'm especially honoured to see my session was picked - especially after seeing the depth of Windows 8 talks submitted.

So what am I talking about?

## Windows 8 - Who Moved My Cheese?

The slides are available on [Heroku](http://ddd-windows8.heroku.com).
