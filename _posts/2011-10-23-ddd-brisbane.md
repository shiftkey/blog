The [dddBrisbane][1] organisers sent out a call over the weekend to finalise the schedule - some very cool talks that I'm looking forward to seeing (look for the schedule to appear early this week). I'm especially honoured to see my session was picked - especially after seeing the depth of Windows 8 talks submitted.

So what am I talking about?

## Windows 8 - Who Moved My Cheese?

I'll link back to my abstract once I remember what I submitted, but keep in mind there is another Windows 8 session in the mix - so I'll probably tweak the script to prevent overlap.

What shall we discuss?
