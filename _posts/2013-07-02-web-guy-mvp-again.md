So I got an email late last night from Microsoft:

> Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2013 MicrosoftÂ® MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in ASP.NET/IIS technical communities during the past year.

It's always nice to have your hard work appreciated (and the ASP.NET community - both inside and outside Microsoft) have been a pleasure to work with over the years.
