I'll be doing a talk in early December about Git. Here's the original pitch:

> Are you using Git via the command line? Want to learn some tricks or
> understand more about what Git is actually doing under the hood? This is the
> session for you. This will be mostly live demos, because it's so much more
> fun to see this stuff in action.

I left a footnote in the talk that I hope people noticed:

>  I'd also like to make this session interactive - if you've got questions
> about Git you'd like to see answered, please file an issue here and I'll see
> if I can work the best ones into the talk

Even if you're not attending the talk, I'd love to hear the questions you have
about Git. I have an issue tracker open where you can send me questions:
