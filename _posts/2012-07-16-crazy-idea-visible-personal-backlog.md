Ever since I got back from holidays a few weeks ago I've been in a bit of a rut trying to tackle the backlog of stuff I've been meaning to do (projects half-done, contributions I've promised other people, things I've been meaning to blog about).

### The Experiment

This experiment comes down to three simple things:

 - maintain a list of tasks which need to be done (ordered by priority)
 - focus on one thing at a time
 - make it visible to the world to add some peer input to the situation

For the tool to make this happen, I've decided to use [Trello](https://trello.com/). After using Trello for the Code52 projects in the past, I felt that it was the best fit between ease of administration and ease of viewing.

The board is hosted at [https://trello.com/board/public-backlog/50039c94fe5e1f8037b9b583](https://trello.com/board/public-backlog/50039c94fe5e1f8037b9b583).

### What can you do?

You should be able to leave a comment on any of the items currently there. What sort of comments would help? Things like:

 - "Can you explain this one?" (I've been too brief with a task which may be complex)
 - "Can you do this sooner?" (this is something you are interested in)
 - "Can I help out with this?" (this is something you might be able to help out with)

### Caveats

This is something that I'll flesh out over the next few days and there may be some details missing.

There are some items on the list which are deliberately vague - I'll indicate which tasks are "teasers" at this point in time, but I've got no issues with you seeing where they sit in my priority queue.

And there are some things which I just can't plain talk about (but really need to do anyway) so I'll need to figure out a way to represent them properly. Not everything on my plate at the moment is OSS work :)
