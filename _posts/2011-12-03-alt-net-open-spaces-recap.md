Flew down to Melbourne this weekend to catch up with the locals and talk about various topics. Here's the abridged version - each session was scheduled for about 30 minutes and we (mostly) stuck to the schedule during the day.

### User Groups

We started off the day with a discussion on how people view user groups - what works, how to grow a user group, discussions and war stories and whatnot. A lot of good ideas came out of this, which will hopefully materialies in the new year.

(Aside: we had tacked on a session for talking about open source, but that seemed to have fallen through the cracks when the discussion for user groups went on longer than expected. Sadface.)

### Code Dojo

As a follow up of the ALT.NET code dojo recently, the group discussed [this kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_fourteen_t.html) and various design topics. Unfortunately things got sidetracked (I was most annoyed I hadn't heard about this 'trigram' concept before) and we didn't get to demonstrate a good TDD design before the session expired. But it was still an entertaining discussion on how to tackle a problem, even if we didn't agree on much.

### New Frontiers

After a quick break, we discussed how languages outside the .NET ecosystem have impacted on .NET and what might be coming down the pipe. A few takeaways from the discussion - some people wanted more concepts to be brought into C#, while others were feeling that the "one language to rule them all" didn't feel right.

### RAD Frameworks

And here's where things got entertaining. What started out as a discussion of tools and libraries to simplify building apps. 

First things first: as soon as 'RAD' was mentioned, it was a red rag to much of the audience. It wasn't the intent, but all attempts to refocus the discussion failed miserably.


### Refactoring

### "What if this is as good as it gets?"

### Code Coverage and Analysis
