As this year comes to a close (a few more things to do yet) I wanted to try something different over the holiday season - an internet sabbatical. 

### A What?

From 21 December (when I jump on a plane for the holidays) to 6 January (when I jump on a plane to come back for work) I plan to "go to ground" and avoid the internet.

### Why?

I am burned out - plain and simple. 


I would love to just "power on through" like it wasn't a problem but I've been doing that for the past few weeks already and its not changing much.

Plus I intend to spend a bunch of time here:

Doing stuff like this:

And it has terrible phone reception anyway (yay!)

### The Ground Rules

Here's the low-down:

 - No Internet Access
 - No Twitter/Facebook
 - No checking emails
 - No computers or things that will let me code

But I won't go completely off the reservation:

 - Phone - to keep in contact with friends and family, but that's it 
 - Xbox - I'm keen to play some Assassin's Creed III (or other games) so that's included

And given I won't have technology to report on my progress (pen and paper perhaps?), you'll just have to wait and see how I go.

### Happy Holidays

If you need to get in touch with me over the holidays, there are "old-school" methods (see above) but otherwise I wish you all a happy and safe holiday season and we'll see you all in 2013!
