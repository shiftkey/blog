This is something I've been kicking around in my head for a while, but it took
the collective tech community having a meltdown last week to remind me about it.

And so rather than sit on the sidelines or rant on Twitter, I thought I'd
put pen to paper on it and do something constructive.

I'm not pretending to do something original here -

[people](http://log.paulbetts.org/mentoring-in-tech/) are already throwing
their hats into the ring with similar offerings, so I figure why not do the same?

## The Deal

I want to set aside some time each week for mentoring developers. Pairing on
code, debugging issues, discussing approaches to a problem and tradeoffs, code
reviews, whatever may come up.

Open source is one of my particular passions right now - if you're not sure
where to start, or would like to get involved in the open source world, I'm more
than happy to answer questions or give advice.

## Why?

I've been fortunate enough to have many great mentors in my programming career
to bounce ideas off, discuss problems and possible solutions, and just general
questions sometimes not even related to programming.

I figure this is one way for me to give back to the community that has helped
me out over the years.

## P.S.

My schedule is going to be all over the place in the coming weeks so setting
aside a specific time is gonna be silly (lol timezones). I've also got a couple
of big ticket issues I need to investigate over the next couple of days while
things are fresh in my mind, so that might hold up on kicking things off. And
this is all on top of my regular job.

But feel free to drop me a line in the interim and see what we can line up.
