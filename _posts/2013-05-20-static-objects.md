**Note**: This is just a first pass on the post, as I need to touch on various tools I've used in the past to identify these constraints. But let's start with the concepts.

Someone asked me a question yesterday along the lines of, well, this:

So I wanted to put together a simple guide on how to determine *when* the [Singleton pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a suitable use case - yes, it gets a bad reputation due to misuse, but there are some scenarios where it does add value (and is often necessary).

## How expensive is it to create?

Imagine you have a database connection, let's say [SqlConnection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.aspx) - and you create an instance of it to connect to a database?

**TODO:** show windbg object dump of a SqlConnection object

Inside this database connection you should see a bunch of underlying resources - these are the components which make the magic happen when you perform a "SELECT * FROM Table" in your application.

Many of the classes you create in your application are probably simpler than this - classes to hold data, for example - but once you start interacting with the underlying platform and identify various bottlenecks in your applications this sort of knowledge is invaluable.

## Does an object reflect an underlying resource?

The other thing to keep in mind with objects is what they represent. 

If your application interacts with the network, storage or attached devices, you are likely to face specific constraints on interacting with these resources. 

An example: if you're ever making concurrent web requests to a specific domain, .NET will actually throttle you to two concurrent requests. You can change this if you [know where to look](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fb6y0fyc.aspx) but the defaults are designed to be "good enough" for most scenarios.

Another example is [database connection pools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8xx3tyca.aspx) - a finite number of connections which are maintained and reused over the lifetime of an application - instead of arbitrarily creating, using, and then destroying connections each time we need them. 

## What about my memory footprint?

So assuming the previous two constraints aren't affecting your code, sure, you might be able to get away with creating objects whenever necessary.

Wait, no, you're on a mobile device. Memory becomes a significant constraint on any mobile applications - and the more moving parts you have in a mobile application, the more you need to optimise to reduce the impact of those moving parts.

> I don't need to worry about that, my stack has generational garbage collection (GC).

But that's not really a solution - just a crutch. GC isn't a free lunch - it's overhead that you're now invoking periodically because you were lazy with how you structured your application. 

**TODO:** demonstrate .NET performance counters around GC, with a sample that does stupid things

And in the mobile space every clock cycle matters.

## What about multi-threaded code?

This is the hardest part to discuss, because multi-threaded code is hard. Like, really hard.

The first thing to check for is immutability.

If your object is [immutable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) (that is, you can call the same function on an object **as many times as possible until the end of time** and you'll always get the same result) then it becomes a candidate for being used in this fashion.

**TODO:** discuss multi-threaded hooha annoyances

## What's the damn answer, Brendan?

Ok, so if you've read this far - I thank you.

To sum up when you need to consider:

 - If it's expensive to create, consider it.
 - If it's touching underlying system resources, consider it.
 - If you need to optimise for memory usage, consider it.
 - Go learn how multi-threading *actually* works - no, the TPL is cheating.
