Back from a self-imposed internet break (taking a phone which doesn't do 3G coverage and going rural is a good way to do this) and [Paul](http://twitter.com/aeoth) and [Tobin](http://twitter.com/tobin) couldn't wait to kick off our new collaborative project.

There's a bit more of a blurb on [the website](http://code52.org/about.html) - its an idea we're still wrapping our heads around by using a bit of trial and error. 

We're already hard at work on our [first project](http://code52.org/downmarker) and we'd love to see people drop into the [Jabbr room](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) and get involved. Amd pf course, there's a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/code_52) too to follow.
