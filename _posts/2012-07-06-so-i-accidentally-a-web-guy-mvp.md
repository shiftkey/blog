So I just had this little email land in my inbox last week.

> Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2012 Microsoft MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in ASP.NET/IIS technical communities during the past year.

After the chaos of first half of the year (which I still want to get back to, just trying to summon the energy again after a brief respite to head over to NDC this year) this caught me off-guard, but has been an honour to accept nonetheless.

I'll comment a bit further on the details once I've signed away my life and get an idea of what's involved, but given the ASP.NET dev stack (well, the *good* bits anyway ::smileyface::) is now on [Codeplex](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/) I'm keen to spend some time digging into that and helping out wherever my powers might be of benefit.

There's also shiny things coming along in the upcoming release (I've hacked a bit on Web API, and Single Page Apps is on my radar but I haven't used in anger) which are on my never-ending TODO list.
